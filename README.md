Experimental Nintendo3DS CGFX file C# library

Since the GBATemp community figured out how to extract files
from Nintendo 3DS games, there has been interest in
figuring out the formats used.

This library allows for opening CGFX files and
getting model data in a raw format from them.

This is the library used in my Unity-based CGFX Viewer.
